## Error

    - In js there have different types of error: Type mismatch, Reference, syntax error, Range error, Network error.
    - For a single error our whole program is stopped but we not expect our program will be stopped for this reason we use exception handling.

## Exception Handling

    - there use try catch block for handling error.As a result our whole program willn't stop for a single error.
