## synchronous vs asynchronous

    - js is a single thread, blocking, synchronous programming language.
    - synchronous means sequencial executable program and it can't jump from one to another
    - blocking means when it executes a statement before finishing this statement it willn't go next statement that means it stops into this statement.
